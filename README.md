WebScrapper
===========
*Build for Educational purpose for Node.JS*

A simple scrapper that retrieves some basic data from IMDB.
There is no Frontend as this tool is kept as simple as possible.
Simply Pull this package to your machine and run:
Node app.js "Url-to-IMDB-Movie"

*EDIT*:
I know this is not so useful but it is here for the sake of Learning Node.JS
